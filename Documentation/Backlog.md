# AutoDB Swift

SQL
	- update hook when having fetch-lists, AutoQuery, AutoRelation
	- remember our types for faster encoding of queries
	- test all types

Creating index and changing column type does not work!

Fetching
	- design other common SQL-functions like fetch row, value, etc.

# That is all!

## Don't build cascading deletes and similar!
but think about syncing. Perhaps its a good idea to have some basic functionality for iCloud/Firebase sync?
