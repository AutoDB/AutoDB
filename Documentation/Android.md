The future is cross-compiling, so this library will work for all platforms. That means no ObjC and no Apple-frameworks like Combine, @Observation, UIKit etc. It should of course support Combine and @Observation since used in SwiftUI.

Work in progress, nothing has been tested on other platforms than mac and iOS yet. But since only Foundation and SQLite is imported it should work everywhere.
