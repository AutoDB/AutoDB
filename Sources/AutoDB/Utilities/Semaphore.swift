/**
 Lock free semaphore using Async/Await, it does not guarantee FIFO but tries to.
 Semaphore taken from CommonSwift utility functions
 
 ```
 Use like this:
class Example {
	private let semaphore = Semaphore(value: 1)
	
	private let data: Data?
	func longRunningTask() async -> Data {
		
		// wait until previous work is done, then continue, note that without congestion, this is just incrementing and decrementing an int. Takes basically no extra time.
		await semaphore.wait()
		defer { Task { await semaphore.signal() } }
		
		// if already created, just continue
		if let data { return data }
		
		// Only one will create the data
		let data = ... do the actual work
		self.data = data
		return data
	}
}
```
 
 For reccurring tasks, where you need re-entry to your actor - use a token. If you own a semaphore with a token you can access the restricted area as much as you like.
 There are people who think that this can be done with a NSReccuringLock - that is not the case with async/await with actors. *usually* it will work fine but since an actor may run on different threads it may not (those locks know you own them by checking the currentThread - this is not how you do things with actors).
 
 ```
 class Example {
 
	func reccuringTask(_ token: AutoId? = nil) async {
		
		let token = token ?? AutoId.generateId()
		// wait until previous work is done then continue, unless you are already cleared by the semaphore - then just continue.
		await semaphore.wait(token: token)
		defer { Task { await semaphore.signal(token: token) } }	// signal with token too!
		
		// do whatever work you need to do
		let data = ... do the actual work
		reccuringTask(token)
	}
 }
 ```
