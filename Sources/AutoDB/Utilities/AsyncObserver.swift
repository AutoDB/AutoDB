 TODO: update this outdated doc:
 
 An async sequence that you use to be notified with future data in a sequence. Use it like an array, all objects appended to it will be sent to the observer.
 It has no memory of what has happend but you get all new changes. Note that leaking can happen if you are careless.
 Example of the regular setup:
 
final class ExampleClass: @unchecked Sendable {
	
	// store the task if you want to cancel observation
	var observerTask: Task<Void, Error>?
	func startListening() async {
		
		let observer = try await TheModelClass.changeObserver()
		observerTask = Task { [weak self] in
			for await change in observer {
				// must be weak inside the observer unless you want to handle cancelling yourself
				try await self?.handleChanges(change.operation, change.id)
			}
		}
	}
	
	func handleChanges(_ operation: SQLiteOperation, _ id: AutoId) async throws {
		...
	}
}

 Example of queuing a series of ints and awaiting them, then cancelling the task to release the object:
let observer = AsyncObserver<Int>()
Task {
	// this task will never quit - it will "leak" until the observer is cancelled.
	for await num in observer {
		print("none-quitter got: \(num)")
	}
	print("This will never happen!")
}
let task = Task { [weak self] in
	// this task can be cancelled without needing to cancel everyone
	for await num in observer {
		print("num was: \(num)")
	}
	print("Finished observing")
}

// somewhere else we are doing work:
for index in 0..<10 {
	await observer.append(index)
	try await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(10))
}

// we can stop both by calling: await observer.cancelAll()
// but usually you only want to stop your own observer,
// then the task must be cancelled first and the observer get the cancel message after:
task.cancel()
await observer.cancel()
