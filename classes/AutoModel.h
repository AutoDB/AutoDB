 SWIFT:
 You must define classes like so:
	@objc(ClassName) ClassName: AutoModel
 where ClassName is the name of the class, and it must be globally unique.
 
 AND ALL properties that is to be inserted into DB must get the prefix:
 @objc dynamic 
 
 NOTE:
 We have moved all needed info to AutoModel_docs. Continue reading and writing there!

 We must wait for db to setup before usage, and we must wait in fifo order, BUT we don't want to wait in queues AFTER setup is done. We only need this when asking for tableInfo which is created during setup - everyhing else is done in queues or dedicated threads. SO: always go through AutoDB's dedicated functions to make sure this is thread-safe (and the info exists).

 Auto DB can watch your properties and mark the objects if they have been changed or not. This does not take particularly more CPU power, since it's just toggling a bool. But it ads all changed objects to a weak hashMap, which has a small/insignificant performance penalty.
 By supplying NO to preventObservingProperties observing is allowed and you can call saveAllWithChanges/saveChanges when apropriate. Like when the app closes or every minute, etc. The reason is that most of the times you know when changes has occured and there is a need for saving, having the system keep tabs on changes is then just an unnecessary memory/cpu cost (so it may actually be benefitial).
 The problem is that it is using a weak map - so all object that you have not tucked away in an array or similar are released and the data is lost.
